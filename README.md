## Warning
⚠ The follow project has been placed on hold and all releases have been removed ⚠

### Motivation
Original goal of this project was provide a simple way to clean up data folders.

However, while the project was considered successiful at the time there are some glaring reasons, described below, as to why it is now abandoned.

* Reason 1: With the move to CHILI publish Online the amount of on-prem installs are no decreasing by the day, and thus the number of people who would benefit from this project.
* Reason 2: This project was not tested against large environments, and quickly fails to achieve expect results when tested in a multi GB environment.
* Reason 3: This project was written as an experiment in WPF and unit test do not exist to verify functionality.

Releases were removed due to a slight security concern where an API key was generated by this application that was long lasting, but if this application failed to shutdown, that key would still persist on the server.

### What Now
The code in this project, specially RunHealthAssessment function in [Operations.cs](https://github.com/seancrowe/SpicyDataDoctor/blob/master/SpicyDataDoctor/Operations.cs), still is practical and useful for anyone wishing to develop a data XML cleaner.

This project has been superseded by it's spirital successor: [clean-data-xmls](https://github.com/seancrowe/clean-data-xmls).
